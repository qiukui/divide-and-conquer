In the file main.cpp, I implement some functions by using divide and conquer algorithm. 

1. x_power_n_rec(x,n): return the value of x with power n in a recursively
   x_power_n_dc(x,n):  return the value of x with power n using divide and conq-uer algorithm.

2. bisearch(a,l,r,t): binary search value t in array a between index l and r.

3. fibo(n): return the nth fibonacci value without recursion
   fibo_dc(n): return the nth fibonacci value using divide and conquer algorithm               by computing the multiplication of an array n times.
